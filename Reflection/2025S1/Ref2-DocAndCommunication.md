## Reflection Logs

Date: 19/03/2025

### Overall Progress Overview

We have successfully completed the implementation of customer data access and export functions, which has played a key role in business security and user experience improvement. The project architecture and design decision documents have been reviewed and approved, providing a clear guidance framework for subsequent development work. It is worth noting that we have completed the automatic generation configuration of API documents as scheduled, which has greatly improved development efficiency and the timeliness of document updates.

### Analysis of Successful Experiences

The key factor for the success of this cycle is first reflected in the rationality of task allocation. We assign tasks based on the expertise and interests of team members, so that each member can maximize their value in their areas of expertise. In the process of completing the project architecture and design decision documents, we introduced a design review meeting with the participation of the entire team, which not only improved the quality of the documents, but also deepened the team's understanding of the overall architecture.

### Challenges

The design and implementation of page interaction logic took longer than expected, mainly because of repeated modifications due to insufficient understanding of requirements. Secondly, the development progress of questionnaire-related functions is slow, especially the implementation of version control has encountered technical bottlenecks. The team lacks experience in integrating version control systems with front-end displays and needs more professional knowledge support.

### Improvement strategy

- Ensure a comprehensive and accurate understanding of requirements before development to reduce rework in the later stage. We plan to invite customers to participate in each requirement confirmation stage to verify the completeness and feasibility of requirements from multiple angles.
- For the development of questionnaire functions, we found guidance on best practices of version control systems through learning.
- To improve team communication, we standardized the use of collaboration tools and clarified the time limit requirements for information updates and responses.

### Next Steps

At the same time, we will allocate more resources to the design and implementation of page interaction logic, and implement new communication strategies to provide more accurate time and resource estimates for the next cycle of tasks based on this experience.
