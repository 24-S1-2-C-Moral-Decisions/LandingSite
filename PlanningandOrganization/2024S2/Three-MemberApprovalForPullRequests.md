# DECISION LOG 
## Decision Details 
- Date: Aug 20st, 2024
- Decision Maker: All members

## Background 
To improve code quality and ensure that all changes are thoroughly reviewed, the team has recognized the need for a more structured pull request (PR) approval process. Currently, PRs are approved by individual members, which can lead to potential issues being overlooked. The goal is to establish a more rigorous review process that involves the entire team.

## Decision Options 
- Option 1: Continue with the current process, where PRs can be merged after approval from a single member.
- Option 2: Require at least three members to approve a PR before it can be merged, and discuss all submitted PRs during weekly team meetings to address any concerns.

## Decision Rationale 
The team agreed that requiring at least three approvals would ensure a higher level of scrutiny and help catch potential issues early. Additionally, discussing PRs during weekly meetings would provide an opportunity for open discussion and feedback, further enhancing code quality. This approach balances the need for thorough review with maintaining development efficiency.

## Decision Outcome 
The team decided to adopt Option 2. All PRs will now require approval from at least three members before they can be merged. Furthermore, PRs submitted during the week will be reviewed and discussed at the following team meeting. If no objections are raised, the PRs can be merged.

## Implementation Plan
 1. Update the team's GitHub repository settings to enforce the new rule requiring three approvals for PRs.
 2. Ensure that PRs are added as discussion items in the agenda for each weekly team meeting.
 3. Monitor the process to ensure it is working effectively, making adjustments as needed to avoid unnecessary delays in the development cycle.

## Follow-up Actions
 1. Communicate the new PR approval process to all team members.
 2. Include a review of PRs as a standing item in the weekly team meeting agenda.
 3. Evaluate the impact of this decision on code quality and development speed after the first few weeks of implementation.

## Conclusion
By requiring at least three approvals for each PR and discussing them during team meetings, the team aims to significantly improve code quality while fostering collaboration and shared responsibility for the project's success. This decision reflects a commitment to maintaining high standards in the development process.
