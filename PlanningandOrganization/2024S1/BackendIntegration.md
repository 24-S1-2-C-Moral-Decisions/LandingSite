# DECISION LOG 
## Decision Details 
- Date: 17 Apr 2024
- Decision Maker: Development members and the client
  
## Background 
As our team progresses in the development of our application, integrating the backend with the frontend has become a pivotal concern. We aim to ensure seamless interaction between the two layers to enhance performance, security, and ease of maintenance. The choice of the backend framework is critical as it must support robust database operations, scalable architecture, and integration with our existing frontend technologies. After evaluating various options, the Nest framework stood out due to its compatibility with TypeScript, its architecture similar to Angular, and its comprehensive support for REST APIs, GraphQL, microservices, and WebSockets.

## Decision Options 


- Integrate backend logic using NestJS, independent of the frontend: Develop the backend as a separate layer using NestJS, which interacts with the frontend through API calls.

- Fully integrate backend logic into the Next.js frontend framework: Manage all backend and frontend code within Next.js, including database operations.


## Decision Rationale 
After thorough review of our project requirements, team expertise, and future scalability needs, Option 2 was selected. Key factors influencing this decision included:

- Enhanced Performance and Security: By using NestJS, we can optimize both performance and security better than if the backend and frontend were more tightly integrated.
- Scalability: NestJS provides a scalable architecture which can grow with our application needs, without being tightly coupled to the frontend technology.
- Development Efficiency: NestJS's modular structure and its use of decorators and modules facilitate a clean separation of concerns and more manageable codebase.
- Flexibility in Interaction: This approach allows the frontend to be developed independently of the backend, which can evolve based on separate timelines and requirements.

## Decision Outcome 
The final decision was to adopt NestJS for backend development, maintaining it as an independent layer that communicates with the frontend via APIs. This method was chosen for its robustness, scalability, and flexibility, fitting well with our project's long-term goals.

## Implementation Plan 

The implementation will involve the following steps:

- Set up the initial NestJS project structure with modules corresponding to major application features.
- Develop RESTful APIs using NestJS that the frontend can consume.
- Integrate authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the backend.
- Establish continuous integration and deployment pipelines for the backend.
- Conduct thorough testing, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests as part of the CI/CD process.

## Risks and Mitigation 

Risk: Complexity in managing separate development timelines for frontend and backend.

- Mitigation: Establish clear communication channels and regular synchronization meetings to ensure alignment.

Risk: Integration issues between the frontend and the backend.

- Mitigation: Define and maintain a clear contract for the APIs. Use mock services and API documentation tools like Swagger to ensure both ends meet the agreed specifications.

## Follow-up Actions 

- Regularly update the API documentation to reflect any changes in the backend.
- Schedule cross-functional team meetings to ensure ongoing alignment and address any integration challenges.
- Conduct performance reviews to optimize the interaction between the backend and the frontend.

## Conclusion 

Choosing NestJS for our backend framework while keeping it independent of the frontend aligns with our strategic goals of building a robust, scalable, and secure application. This decision leverages NestJSâ€™s strengths in building efficient, structured backend services and ensures that our application remains flexible to evolving technologies and business requirements.
