# DECISION LOG 
## Decision Details 
- Date: 18 March 2024
- Decision Maker: All team members and the client
  
## Background 
Following the implementation of the Immersive Test on our Entry Page, we observed a significant opportunity to enhance how we present test results to our users. Initially, feedback was provided on a single, static page, which limited our ability to convey detailed insights and potentially engage users further. To address this, we considered redesigning the feedback presentation to offer a more comprehensive and interactive experience.

## Decision Options 

- **Option 1**: Keep the existing single-page feedback presentation with minor improvements to content and layout.
- **Option 2**: Develop a dynamic, multi-section page format that allows for an expansive presentation of test results across different data dimensions.
- **Option 3**: Integrate an interactive dashboard within the existing page, allowing users to explore their results in a more granular, self-directed manner.
- **Option 4**: Utilize external tools or platforms to present test feedback, redirecting users outside the main site for a detailed analysis.

## Decision Rationale 
The decision was to proceed with Option 2, transitioning the feedback presentation to a dynamic, long-page landing page format. This format will allow for a comprehensive display of Immersive Test results across various dimensions, providing users with a more insightful and engaging overview of their performance and areas for improvement.

## Decision Outcome 
The final decision was to proceed with **Option 3**, the full transition to a dynamic design incorporating both interactive elements and animations. This decision was made to significantly enhance the user experience by creating a more immersive and engaging interface, which is expected to lead to higher user retention and satisfaction rates.

## Implementation Plan 

The web design team will be tasked with developing a prototype of the new feedback presentation format within two weeks. This phase will focus on creating a visually appealing and intuitive design that effectively communicates the test results to users. Feedback from internal stakeholders and select user groups will guide iterative improvements to the design.

Upon finalizing the design, the web development team will implement the dynamic, long-page layout, ensuring compatibility across devices and browsers.

## Risks and Mitigation 

- **Risk**: Increased complexity in design and development could extend project timelines.
- **Mitigation**: Prioritize core features for the initial rollout, with additional features to be introduced in subsequent updates.

## Follow-up Actions 

- **Web Design Team**: Initiate prototype development and plan for stakeholder and user feedback sessions.
- **Web Development Team**: Prepare for the implementation phase, ensuring all necessary tools and resources are available.
- **Project Manager**: Monitor progress and facilitate cross-team communication to address any issues promptly.

## Conclusion 

The shift towards a dynamic and interactive Entry Page design marks a pivotal move in enhancing user engagement and satisfaction. By adopting a streamlined implementation plan and preparing for potential risks, we aim to deliver a product that not only meets but exceeds user expectations, setting a new standard for excellence in web design.
