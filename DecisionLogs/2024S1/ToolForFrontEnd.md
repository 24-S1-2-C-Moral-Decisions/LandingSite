# DECISION LOG

## Decision Details
- Date: March 10, 2024
- Decision Maker: All team members

## Background
The project "AI + Human Exploration of Daily Moral Decisions" is aimed at creating a platform that delves into everyday moral dilemmas, bridging a gap in current AI and ethics research. A crucial component of this project is the development of an interactive website that facilitates the exploration of these dilemmas. Given the project’s objectives and the need for a robust, scalable, and developer-friendly platform, a decision was required regarding the choice of technology for the front-end development.

## Decision Options
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, known for its flexibility and component-based architecture.
- **Angular**: A platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript.
- **Vue.js**: A progressive framework for building user interfaces, designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable.
- **Next.js**: A React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React-based web applications.

## Decision Rationale
The decision to choose a technology for the front-end development was influenced by several factors:
- **Developer Experience**: The technology should be easy for the team to adopt and must support rapid development.
- **Performance**: The need for fast loading times and seamless interaction for users was paramount.
- **SEO**: The platform’s content needs to be SEO-friendly to reach a wider audience.
- **Scalability**: As the project aims to engage users globally, the technology must easily scale.
- **Community and Support**: A strong community and availability of support resources are essential for addressing potential challenges during development.

After thorough consideration, including the team's familiarity with the technologies and the specific requirements of the project, Next.js was identified as the most suitable option. Its server-side rendering capabilities enhance SEO and improve load times, while its support for React allows for a modular and scalable application structure. Moreover, Next.js has a large community and extensive documentation, which ensures support throughout the development process.

## Decision Outcome
The team decided to proceed with **Next.js** for the front-end development of the "AI + Human Exploration of Daily Moral Decisions" project. This choice was made due to Next.js’s comprehensive features that align with the project's needs, such as improved SEO, performance, scalability, and its developer-friendly environment.

## Implementation Plan
The implementation plan involves the following steps:
- **Week 3 to Week 6**: Front-end development using Next.js, focusing on implementing the UI designs and ensuring responsiveness across devices.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Xinlong Wu: Oversee project coordination and maintain client communication.
  - Ceming Fu and Zhongzheng Huang: Lead the front-end development efforts.
  - Xuan Liu and Shiying Cai: Conduct ongoing website testing to ensure functionality and user experience.

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Learning Curve**: Some team members might be less familiar with Next.js. **Mitigation**: Conduct initial training sessions and allocate time for learning.
- **Integration Challenges**: Potential difficulties in integrating Next.js with the back-end. **Mitigation**: Regularly review the integration process and adjust the development approach as needed.

## Follow-up Actions
- **Training for Team Members**: Organize a series of workshops on Next.js within the first week of the implementation phase.
- **Development Milestones Review**: Weekly meetings to track progress, discuss challenges, and adapt plans accordingly.

## Conclusion
The decision to use Next.js for the front-end development of the project is expected to significantly contribute to achieving a seamless user experience and meeting the project’s technical requirements. This decision aligns with the project's goal of creating a robust platform for exploring moral dilemmas, ensuring scalability, performance, and a wide reach.
