# DECISION LOG

## Decision Details

- Date: 29/09/2024
- Decision Maker: All team members 

## Background

The website was initially hosted on a free version of a South African server. However, this led to slow data loading and poor site response times, negatively impacting the user experience. To improve performance and reduce latency, the team explored other server options.

## Decision Options

- **Option 1:** **Continue using the free South African server:** Accept slow response times due to server location.

- **Option 2:** **Upgrade to an Australian server:** Leverage a two-month free trial, with the possibility of school funding for ongoing costs.

## Decision Rationale

Option 2 was chosen to **switch to the Australian server** because:

- **Faster data loading:** Proximity to the user base would reduce latency.
- **Cost-effectiveness:** The two-month free trial provides immediate relief, and the school can apply for funding, with a budget of $500.
- **Improved user experience:** Faster response times would enhance overall site performance and user satisfaction.

## Decision Outcome

The decision was made to **switch to an Australian server**, utilizing the two-month free trial while the school applies for funding to cover future costs.

## Implementation Plan

- **Timeline:** Implementation to be completed on 29/09/2024
- **Responsible Parties:** Xinlong Wu

## Conclusion

Switching to the Australian server is expected to significantly improve website performance by reducing latency and speeding up data loading, creating a better user experience. The school funding application will help support ongoing server costs.
