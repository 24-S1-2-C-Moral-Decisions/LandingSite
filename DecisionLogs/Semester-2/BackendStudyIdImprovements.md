# DECISION LOG

## Decision Details
- **Date:** 16/09/2024
- **Decision Maker:** Backend development team

## Background
The current backend system faced limitations in handling multiple survey pages and lacked robust error handling for invalid inputs. To improve system scalability and reliability, changes to the studyid indexing and error handling logic were necessary.

## Decision Options
- **Option 1:** Modify the studyid indexing to support 5 survey pages and rewrite the backend testing logic.
- **Option 2:** Keep the current studyid indexing and focus only on improving error handling.
- **Option 3:** Implement a completely new backend structure to address both issues.

## Decision Rationale
Modifying the studyid indexing allows for future expansion of survey pages, enhancing the system's scalability. Rewriting the backend testing logic to return bad requests for invalid inputs improves error handling and system reliability. This approach balances immediate needs with future scalability while minimizing disruption to the existing system.

## Decision Outcome
The team decided to implement Option 1: Modify the studyid indexing to support 5 survey pages and rewrite the backend testing logic for improved error handling.

## Implementation Plan
- **Timeline:** Completed by 16 September 2024
- **Responsible Parties:** Backend development team

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk:** Potential compatibility issues with existing frontend components.
  - **Mitigation:** Thorough testing of all frontend-backend interactions and gradual rollout of changes.
- **Risk:** Increased complexity in maintaining the expanded studyid indexing.
  - **Mitigation:** Comprehensive documentation of the new indexing system and regular code reviews.

## Follow-up Actions
- Update all relevant documentation to reflect the new studyid indexing system.
- Conduct a comprehensive test suite to ensure proper functioning of the new error handling logic.
- Inform frontend developers of the changes in error responses to ensure proper handling on the client side.
- Schedule a review session in one month to assess the impact of these changes on system performance and user experience.

## Conclusion
The decision to modify the studyid indexing and improve error handling significantly enhances the backend's capability to support multiple survey pages and handle invalid inputs more effectively. These improvements lay a solid foundation for future system expansions while immediately addressing current limitations in error management.
