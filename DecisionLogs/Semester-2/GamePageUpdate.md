# DECISION LOG 
## Decision Details 
- Date: 31.7.2024
- Decision Maker: All team members and the client
  
## Background 
Game pages can increase users' interest in products and help them better understand them. But the previous game interface did not inspire users' enthusiasm, so we developed a new game interface. This interface helps users understand the product through a dialog box format. 

## Decision Options 


- Option 1: Add the dialog.

- Option 2: Set animation.

## Decision Rationale 

Increasing the fun performance of the game helps us attract users to experience our product. This is consistent with our needs. 
Through the game interface, we hope that users will be interested in our product, thereby increasing their interest and patience in completing the following surveys. 
The decision was made based on user feedback, which emphasized that the original game interface was somewhat boring.

## Decision Outcome 
So we ultimately decided to upgrade the game interface. By introducing dialogue boxes and allowing users to interact, we aim to stimulate their interest in the product and ensure that they can complete our subsequent surveys.

## Implementation Plan 

- Timeline: Before 7 August 2024
- Responsible Parties: Zhenhao Li will lead the implementation.

## Risks and Mitigation 

- **Risk:** Users may not know how to play this game.
- **Mitigation:** Ensure this game so easy to play.
    
## Follow-up Actions 

- Communicate the change to the development team and update any related documentation.

## Conclusion 

After updating the game interface, we hope to attract users to participate in our follow-up survey. This decision can help us improve the user experience and ensure that users can successfully complete subsequent surveys
