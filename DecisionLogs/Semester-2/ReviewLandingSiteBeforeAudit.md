# DECISION LOG 

## Decision Details 
- Date: 30/08/2024
- Decision Maker: All team members
  
## Background 
During the previous audit, it was discovered that some entries in the decision log and the landing page were outdated or incomplete. To prevent this in future audits, we recognized the need for a more structured review process to ensure all decision log entries are up-to-date and accurate.

## Decision Options 

- **Option 1:** Assign one team member to review the decision log before every audit.
- **Option 2:** Have each team member individually review the decision log to catch potential mistakes or missing information.
- **Option 3:** Implement a group review session where the team collectively checks the decision log before each audit.

## Decision Rationale 
We chose **Option 2**, where each team member is responsible for reviewing the decision log before an audit. This ensures multiple perspectives in reviewing the content and avoids placing the entire responsibility on a single individual. By having everyone review it, we reduce the likelihood of errors or omissions, ensuring the decision log and landing page are fully up-to-date.

## Decision Outcome 
Going forward, before every audit, each team member will review the decision log to ensure that all entries are current, complete, and match the content on the landing page.

## Implementation Plan 

- Before each audit, every team member will review the decision log.
- If discrepancies or outdated information are found, team members will update the log accordingly.
- A final group review will occur to confirm that everything is correct and synchronized with the landing page.

## Risks and Mitigation 

- **Risk:** Some team members might overlook errors or fail to review the log in time.
  - **Mitigation:** Set a deadline for review completion and use a checklist to ensure everyone participates in the review process.

## Follow-up Actions 

- Each team member is responsible for reviewing the decision log at least 48 hours before the audit.
- Final review session to be scheduled prior to the audit to confirm everything is updated.

## Conclusion 

This decision ensures that the decision log and landing page remain current and error-free, improving the team's audit preparedness. By assigning responsibility to each member, we increase accountability and reduce the risk of missed updates or incomplete information.
