# DECISION LOG 

## Decision Details 
- Date: 12/09/2024
- Decision Maker: Xinlong Wu, Siying Cai, Ceming Fu
  
## Background 
The team faced challenges ensuring the search page displayed properly across different screen sizes on desktop devices. We aimed to maintain UI consistency without making extensive modifications while ensuring a seamless user experience on various screen resolutions.

## Decision Options 

- **Option 1:** Make extensive changes to the UI to fit different screen sizes.
- **Option 2:** Use conditional visibility of certain elements based on screen size, hiding less essential parts when the screen is smaller.
- **Option 3:** Redesign the layout entirely for different screen sizes, creating separate versions for small and large screens.

## Decision Rationale 
The team chose to adopt **Option 2** to minimize UI modifications while achieving responsive design across various screen sizes. This approach allows the banner and hot topic column to adjust or hide based on the screen size, reducing complexity and development time. It also ensures a balanced and clean user experience.

## Decision Outcome 
We decided that when the page width is smaller than 1024px, the side banner will be hidden. When the page width is smaller than 768px, the hot topic column will also be hidden. This method ensures smooth responsiveness without needing substantial changes to the overall UI design.

## Implementation Plan 

- Update the search page CSS to include media queries for hiding the banner and hot topic column.
- Front-end developers will implement and test these changes.
- Ensure thorough testing on different devices and screen sizes to confirm responsiveness.

## Risks and Mitigation 

- **Risk:** The layout may not display properly on uncommon screen sizes or very large screens.
  - **Mitigation:** Test the design on various screen resolutions and devices to ensure consistency.

## Follow-up Actions 

- Responsible party: Front-end team to implement changes by [specific date].
- Testing across multiple devices to ensure the design remains user-friendly at different screen sizes.

## Conclusion 

This decision balances responsiveness with minimal changes to the existing UI. It allows the search page to adapt to different screen sizes effectively while preserving the design and ensuring consistency across devices. This approach saves time and resources while improving the user experience.
