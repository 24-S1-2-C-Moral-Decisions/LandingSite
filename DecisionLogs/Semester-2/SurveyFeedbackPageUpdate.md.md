# DECISION LOG

## Decision Details

- Date: 28/08/20254
- Decision Maker: All team members and the client

## Background

The original Survey Feedback Page relied solely on user comments for analysis. However, not all participants provided comments, which limited the effectiveness of the feedback. To enhance the value and appeal of the feedback page, it was decided to consider integrating personality and decision-making radar charts as additional analytical tools. This would provide more comprehensive and engaging content.

## Decision Options

- **Option 1:** **Continue with the current feedback model:** Rely solely on user comments for feedback analysis.

- **Option 2:** **Add personality and decision-making radar charts:** Supplement the current feedback model with additional analytical tools.

- **Option 3:** **Replace the comment-based feedback model:** Use personality and decision-making radar charts exclusively, instead of relying on user comments.

## Decision Rationale

Option 3 was chosen to **replace the existing comment-based feedback model** with personality and decision-making radar charts because:

- **Increases engagement:** By offering more varied feedback.
- **Enhances user experience:** Provides meaningful insights even when comments are absent.
- **Improves overall effectiveness:** Ensures valuable feedback for all users, regardless of comment availability.

## Decision Outcome

The decision was made to **replace the existing comment-based feedback model** with personality and decision-making radar charts on the Survey Feedback Page, aiming to create a more robust and engaging user experience.

## Implementation Plan
