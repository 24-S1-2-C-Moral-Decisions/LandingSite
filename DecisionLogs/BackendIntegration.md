# DECISION LOG 
## Decision Details 
- Date: 17 Apr 2024
- Decision Maker: Development members and the client
  
## Background 
As our project progresses, the need to streamline and optimize our development process has become evident. The team aimed to integrate backend functionalities directly within our frontend framework to improve collaboration, reduce deployment complexity, and leverage the full-stack capabilities of Next.js. This integration involves handling server-side operations such as API routes and database interactions directly within Next.js, aligning with our goals to simplify development and improve maintainability.

## Decision Options 


- Use separate backend and frontend frameworks: Maintain traditional separation with distinct backend services.

- Fully integrate backend logic into the Next.js frontend framework: Manage all backend and frontend code within Next.js, including database operations.


## Decision Rationale 
After evaluating our project’s infrastructure, scalability needs, and the team’s expertise, Option 2 was chosen. The decision was influenced by several factors:

- Simplicity and efficiency: Integrating both backend and frontend in Next.js simplifies the development process and deployment pipeline.
- Improved collaboration: Developers can work more closely when backend and frontend code coexist in the same framework, reducing the overhead of managing multiple technologies.
- Cost-effectiveness: Reduces the need for multiple servers and technology stacks, lowering operational costs.

## Decision Outcome 
The team decided to proceed with fully integrating backend functionalities into the Next.js framework. This decision leverages the full-stack capabilities of Next.js to simplify our technology stack and streamline development processes.

## Implementation Plan 

The implementation will proceed as follows:

- Migrate existing backend logic to Next.js, utilizing API routes and server-side functions within the framework.
- Train the development team on handling full-stack operations within Next.js.
- Integrate database operations directly within Next.js, ensuring proper security and performance optimizations.
- Establish continuous integration and deployment processes to handle the unified codebase.

## Risks and Mitigation 

**Risk**: Potential performance issues with Next.js handling large-scale backend operations.

- Mitigation: Conduct performance testing and optimizations regularly; consider splitting services if specific scalability issues arise.

**Risk**: Increased complexity in managing a full-stack environment within a single framework.

- Mitigation: Provide comprehensive training and documentation for the development team; use modular architecture within Next.js to maintain code clarity and separation of concerns.

## Follow-up Actions 

- Schedule training sessions for the development team on Next.js full-stack capabilities.
- Set up regular code reviews to ensure best practices in full-stack development are followed.
- Monitor system performance and scalability regularly, adjusting the architecture as needed based on feedback and metrics.

## Conclusion 

Adopting a full-stack approach using Next.js represents a strategic decision to streamline our development process, enhance team collaboration, and reduce operational complexities. This approach is expected to accelerate development cycles, improve deployment efficiency, and maintain high standards of quality and performance.
