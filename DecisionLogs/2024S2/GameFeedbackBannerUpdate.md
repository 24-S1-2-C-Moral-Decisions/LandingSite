## Background

The current **Game Feedback Page** has a banner and slogan to attract users to take the survey. However, there is an opportunity to update the banner and slogan to better reflect the site's overall style and increase user engagement. To enhance the visual appeal and effectiveness of the page, two design options were considered.

- **Improves cohesion**: The new design aligns more closely with the website's overall look and feel.
- **Increases engagement**: The updated slogan is designed to be more appealing and resonate better with users, potentially increasing interaction on the feedback page.
- **Enhances user experience**: A fresh design is likely to draw more attention and make the feedback process more visually appealing, encouraging users to engage with the content.

## Decision Outcome

The decision was made to proceed with the redesigned banner and updated slogan on the **Game Feedback Page** to improve user engagement and ensure consistency with the overall website design.
