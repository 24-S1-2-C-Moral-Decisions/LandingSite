# DECISION LOG

## Decision Details
- **Date:** 7 August 2024
- **Decision Maker:** All team members and the client

## Background
The entry game feedback page currently includes a radar chart that displays detailed results. However, feedback indicates that this chart is complex and may contribute to information overload. Simplifying the feedback page is crucial to maintaining user engagement and ensuring that participants remain interested and patient with the subsequent survey.

## Decision Options
- **Option 1:** Remove the radar chart from the feedback page.
- **Option 2:** Simplify the radar chart but keep it on the feedback page.
- **Option 3:** Retain the radar chart and provide additional explanations.

## Decision Rationale
Removing the radar chart will simplify the results presentation and reduce cognitive load for users. This approach aligns with our goal of enhancing user experience by making the feedback page more straightforward, thereby increasing user interest and patience for completing the following survey. The decision is based on user feedback, which highlighted that complex visualizations were a barrier to engagement.

## Decision Outcome
The final decision is to remove the radar chart from the entry game feedback page. This choice was selected to streamline the feedback process and improve user engagement with subsequent surveys.

## Implementation Plan
- **Timeline:** Before 14 August 2024
- **Responsible Parties:** Xuan Liu will lead the implementation.

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk:** Users may miss out on valuable feedback insights without the radar chart.
  - **Mitigation:** Ensure alternative feedback methods are clear and provide sufficient context to capture essential insights.

## Follow-up Actions
- Update the feedback page design to remove the radar chart.
- Communicate the change to the development team and update any related documentation.

## Conclusion
Removing the radar chart from the feedback page will simplify the presentation of results and potentially improve user engagement with subsequent surveys. This decision supports our objective to reduce information overload and enhance overall user experience.
