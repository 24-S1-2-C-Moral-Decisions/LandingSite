# DECISION LOG 
## Decision Details 
- Date: 16 March 2024
- Decision Maker: All team members and the client
  
## Background 
In our efforts to enhance user engagement and improve the overall user experience on our platform, the design team proposed a significant shift in the approach to our Entry Page design. Recognizing the need to evolve from a static presentation to a more engaging, dynamic interface, we considered incorporating interactive elements and animations. This change aimed at creating a more immersive experience, facilitating a smoother navigation process for our users.

## Decision Options 

- **Option 1**: Maintain the current static design, focusing on content updates and minor aesthetic improvements.
- **Option 2**: Partially integrate interactive elements without animations, to add a slight dynamic aspect while keeping the interface relatively simple.
- **Option 3**: Fully transition to a dynamic design, integrating both interactive elements and animations to enhance user immersion and engagement.

## Decision Rationale 
After careful consideration, including user feedback and technical feasibility assessment, we leaned towards Option 3. This option was favored because it aligned with our strategic objectives of increasing user engagement and providing a modern, seamless user experience. Additionally, internal capabilities and resource availability made this option a practical choice, ensuring that the implementation could be managed effectively within our timeline and budget constraints.

## Decision Outcome 
The final decision was to proceed with **Option 3**, the full transition to a dynamic design incorporating both interactive elements and animations. This decision was made to significantly enhance the user experience by creating a more immersive and engaging interface, which is expected to lead to higher user retention and satisfaction rates.

## Implementation Plan 

The implementation of the dynamic design for the Entry Page will commence with the prototype design team tasked to deliver an initial draft within one week. This initial phase is dedicated to creating a comprehensive draft that will be presented to the remaining team members and clients for feedback. The design phase is anticipated to be highly dynamic, involving multiple iterations to refine and optimize the design based on feedback, ensuring a smooth transition to the development phase.

Upon receiving approval of the final design from all stakeholders, the web development team will begin the development phase. This process involves translating the approved dynamic and interactive design concepts into a fully functional and responsive web page, with particular attention to maintaining high performance and accessibility standards.

## Risks and Mitigation 

- **Risk**: Prolonged prototype design phase due to the complexity of integrating dynamic elements, potentially delaying the project timeline.
- **Mitigation**: Implement agile design methodologies to allow for rapid iteration based on feedback, and allocate additional resources if necessary to meet deadlines.

## Follow-up Actions 

- **Prototype Design Team**: Complete the initial draft within one week and prepare for presentation to the team and clients.
- **All Team Members and Clients**: Provide feedback on the initial draft to guide further iterations.
- **Web Development Team**: Prepare for the development phase following final design approval, ensuring all necessary tools and resources are in place.

## Conclusion 

The shift towards a dynamic and interactive Entry Page design marks a pivotal move in enhancing user engagement and satisfaction. By adopting a streamlined implementation plan and preparing for potential risks, we aim to deliver a product that not only meets but exceeds user expectations, setting a new standard for excellence in web design.
