# DECISION LOG 
## Decision Details 
- Date: 6 March 2024
- Decision Maker: All team members and the client
  
## Background 
The initiative to redesign our website's entry page stemmed from qualitative feedback and industry best practices highlighting the necessity for enhanced user engagement right from the initial interaction. Internal reviews underscored the potential of interactive elements to capture and maintain user interest, leading to the exploration of innovative solutions that could seamlessly merge information delivery with user involvement.

## Decision Options 

- **Option 1:** Maintain the current static entry page, focusing on graphical and textual content to inform users.
- **Option 2:** Develop an interactive scenario simulation game that introduces the websiteâ€™s theme and content in an engaging manner.
- **Option 3:**  Implement a video walkthrough of the website, providing visual and auditory engagement.

## Decision Rationale 
The team conducted a series of brainstorming sessions to weigh the merits of each option against our objective of increasing initial user engagement. We evaluated the potential of each approach to captivate users' attention, ease of implementation, cost, scalability, and the uniqueness of the user experience. Opinions in web design, user experience and creative concepts were discussed with the client for preliminary feedback.

## Decision Outcome 
The final decision was to proceed with **Option 2**, the development of an interactive scenario simulation game. This option was chosen for its potential to provide an engaging, informative, and memorable first interaction with our website. It promises to encourage exploration, provoke thought, and offer an innovative way to present complex content, aligning with our brand's commitment to impactful user experiences.

## Implementation Plan 

The implementation of the interactive scenario simulation game will commence with the design team tasked to deliver an initial draft of the detailed design within one week. The design phase is expected to be dynamic, with the possibility of multiple iterations to achieve the optimal design before development begins, ensuring a seamless transition from design to development and ultimately to user deployment.

Upon approval of the final design, the web development team will initiate the development phase. 



## Risks and Mitigation 

Potential risks include delays in development, and the game not resonating with the target audience. To mitigate these risks, we will adopt an agile development approach with weekly sprints and reviews. 

## Follow-up Actions 

- Finalize the game concept and storyline by 09 March 2024.
- Complete the first prototype for internal testing by 12 March 2024.

## Conclusion 

The decision to implement an interactive scenario simulation game as our website's entry page marks a significant stride towards redefining user interaction and immersion. This forward-thinking approach is anticipated to enhance the user's initial experience, potentially reducing bounce rates and fostering a deeper connection with our audience.
