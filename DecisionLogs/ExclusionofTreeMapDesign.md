# DECISION LOG 
## Decision Details 
- Date: 25/07/2024
- Decision Maker: All Members
  
## Background 
During the planning phase of the website development project, the team initially considered incorporating a tree map to visualize specialized knowledge related to daily moral decision research. However, due to the complexity and specialized nature of the information, the team encountered challenges in finding an effective way to present this knowledge. To ensure the smooth progress of the project, the decision was made to exclude the tree map design from the initial website development phase. The focus will instead be on advancing the website's overall development and survey creation. This approach allows the team to prioritize essential functionalities and gather user feedback, which can inform future enhancements, including the potential integration of the tree map.

## Decision Options 

- Option 1: Include the tree map design in the initial website development, despite the current challenges in presenting the specialized information effectively.
- Option 2: Exclude the tree map design from the initial development and focus on developing the website and survey functionalities, postponing the tree map integration to a future phase.


## Decision Rationale 

The decision to go with Option 2 was based on the following considerations:

- Feasibility: The specialized nature of the tree map content requires a more tailored approach, which would delay the overall website development. Prioritizing website and survey functionalities ensures that the project remains on schedule.
- User Feedback: By focusing on the website's core functionalities, the team can gather early user feedback, which will be valuable in shaping the future integration of more complex features like the tree map.
- Resource Allocation: Allocating resources to essential components first ensures a stable and functional platform, providing a solid foundation for future enhancements.


## Decision Outcome 

We defined two APIs to support the survey process:

- Focus on Core Development: The team will prioritize the development of the website's core functionalities, including the survey distribution and data collection processes.
- Postpone Tree Map Design: The tree map design will be reconsidered in a future phase, after gathering user feedback and ensuring a more effective presentation method is developed.

## Conclusion 

By excluding the tree map design from the initial website development, the team can focus on delivering a stable and functional platform while gathering valuable user feedback. This decision not only ensures the timely delivery of the project but also aligns with the goal of providing a high-quality and user-friendly experience. The future consideration of the tree map integration will be guided by the insights gained during this initial phase.
