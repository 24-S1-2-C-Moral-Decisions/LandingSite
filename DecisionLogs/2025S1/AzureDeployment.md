# DECISION LOG 
## Decision Details 
- Date: March 11, 2025
- Decision Maker: All Members
  
## Background 
We encountered persistent issues with the backend remote server becoming unavailable, causing significant disruptions to our service reliability. These outages resulted in degraded user experience and increased support tickets. After analyzing the situation, we determined that our current hosting solution lacked proper redundancy.

## Decision Options 

The following options were considered to address the backend server unavailability issue:

- Option 1: Troubleshoot and optimize the existing server configuration while maintaining the current infrastructure

- Option 2: Migrate the backend services to Microsoft Azure cloud platform

- Option 3: Switch to a different cloud provider (AWS or Google Cloud Platform)


## Decision Rationale 
Our development team has existing experience with Microsoft Azure services and the associated development tools. A comparative cost analysis showed that Azure offered the best balance of features and pricing for our specific workload patterns.



## Decision Outcome 
We decided to migrate our backend services to Azure platform. This decision was primarily based on Azure's robust reliability features, including regional redundancy and comprehensive monitoring tools. This method provided the most straightforward migration path given our team's existing expertise.

## Implementation Plan 

1.  Set up Azure environment and configure network settings
   - Responsible: Yu Ma, Zhenhao Li, Lingziluo Xiong
   - Resources: Azure subscription, network configuration documentation

2.  Testing, monitoring setup, and performance optimization
   - Responsible: Zehua Kong, Fei Li, Shutong Li, Zihao Li
   - Resources: Testing protocols, Azure Monitor configuration

## Risks and Mitigation 

1. **Risk**: Potential data loss during migration
   - **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive backup strategy before migration and perform test migrations with data validation

2. **Risk**: Service interruption during shutdown
   - **Mitigation**: Schedule migration during off-peak hours and implement blue-green deployment approach

3. **Risk**: Unexpected Azure service costs
   - **Mitigation**: Set up cost alerts, right-size resources, and implement auto-scaling rules to optimize resource usage

4. **Risk**: Team unfamiliarity with certain Azure services
   - **Mitigation**: Conduct focused training sessions and engage Microsoft support when needed

## Follow-up Actions 

2. Develop detailed monitoring dashboard for Azure services
   
3. Review performance metrics and cost optimization after one month of operation
   
3. Document deployment processes

## Conclusion 

The decision to migrate our backend services to Azure represents a strategic shift toward a more resilient, scalable architecture that better aligns with our application's growing demands. The implementation of the services will allow our development team to focus more on feature development rather than infrastructure maintenance, ultimately delivering better value to our users and stakeholders.
