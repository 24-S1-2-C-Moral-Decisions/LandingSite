# DECISION LOG 
## Decision Details 
- Date: 17/04/2024
- Decision Maker: All Members
  
## Background 
As part of the development strategy for our project, the choice of the backend framework is critical to ensure robust, scalable, and efficient API services. The team had to choose between leveraging Next.js for both front-end and backend API development for unified service deployment, and adopting Nest.js, a framework designed specifically for backend services that offers similarities to SpringBoot, a framework familiar to several team members.

## Decision Options 
- Option 1: Use Next.js for both front-end and backend development, taking advantage of its capability to manage both and simplify deployment.
- Option 2: Adopt Nest.js for the backend to benefit from its robust backend-specific features and automatic API documentation generation.
[List the different options or alternatives that were considered when making the decision.] 


## Decision Rationale 
The decision to opt for Nest.js as the backend framework was driven by several compelling reasons:

- Expertise Utilization: Leveraging the existing SpringBoot experience of three team members, which aligns well with Nest.js's similar architecture and syntax, enabling a quicker mastery and more efficient development.
- Documentation Efficiency: Nest.js's capability to automatically generate API documentation, which significantly reduces the time and effort required for maintaining up-to-date documentation.
- Framework Suitability: Nest.js's focus on backend services provides more specialized tools and features tailored for backend development compared to Next.js, which is primarily a front-end framework with added backend capabilities.


## Decision Outcome 
After thorough evaluation, the team unanimously decided to proceed with Nest.js for developing the backend services. This decision allows the project to capitalize on the specialized backend capabilities of Nest.js while efficiently utilizing the existing skills within the team. Furthermore, the automatic generation of API documentation by Nest.js will streamline the development process and reduce overhead tasks.

## Conclusion 

Choosing Nest.js as the backend framework aligns well with the team's expertise and the project's need for efficient, robust backend services. This decision is expected to enhance the development process, optimize resource use, and provide a scalable solution for backend development, all while ensuring that the project's documentation remains thorough and easy to manage.
