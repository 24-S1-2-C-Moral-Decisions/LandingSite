# DECISION LOG 
## Decision Details 
- Date: 12 March 2024
- Decision Maker: All team members and the client
  
## Background 
The original entry page scenario featuring the moral dilemma of "whom to save from drowning" received feedback indicating that it did not adequately align with the website's focus on everyday moral decisions. Our content is dedicated to engaging users with scenarios that reflect the moral choices they might encounter in their daily lives, thus necessitating a revision of the entry page scenario to better match our thematic direction.

## Decision Options 

- **Option 1:** Retain the original "rescue" scenario and adjust its narrative to fit everyday contexts.
- **Option 2:** Replace the scenario with a common daily moral decision, such as choosing between truth and white lies in social situations.
- **Option 3:** Develop a variety of daily scenarios and allow users to choose which to explore upon entry.

## Decision Rationale 
The decision was made to opt for **Option 2**, creating a new scenario that users are likely to face in their everyday lives. This approach will foster immediate relevance and invite users to contemplate and interact with the kind of moral decisions that align with the everyday theme of the website.

## Decision Outcome 
The final decision was to proceed with **Option 2**, the development of an interactive scenario simulation game. This option was chosen for its potential to provide an engaging, informative, and memorable first interaction with our website. It promises to encourage exploration, provoke thought, and offer an innovative way to present complex content, aligning with our brand's commitment to impactful user experiences.

## Implementation Plan 

The content team is tasked with devising a new scenario that encapsulates an everyday moral decision. This scenario will be drafted and presented for review within one week. Upon approval, the web development team will integrate the new scenario into the website's entry page. 

## Risks and Mitigation 

There is a risk that the new scenario may not engage users as intended. To mitigate this, the content team will work closely with the web development and design teams to ensure the scenario is compelling and interactive. Regular internal reviews will be conducted to assess the scenario's alignment with our website's theme and its potential to provoke thoughtful engagement. If the scenario does not meet our engagement criteria, the team will promptly iterate on the content and design until a satisfactory level of user engagement is anticipated.

By focusing on internal collaboration and iterative improvement, this approach aims to efficiently address any engagement issues without the need for external user testing.

## Follow-up Actions 

- Design team to deliver the new scenario draft by 20 March 2024.

## Conclusion 

The change to an everyday moral decision scenario for our entry page is expected to better represent the website's ethos and enhance user engagement by offering a more relatable and thought-provoking experience.
