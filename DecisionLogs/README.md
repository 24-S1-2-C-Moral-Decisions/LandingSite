# Decision Logs

## Overview
The Decision Log System is a tool designed to track and manage decisions made within a project or organization. By logging decisions, including the context, rationale, options considered, and outcomes, teams can improve transparency, responsibility, and learning. 

This [Decision Logs](/) of our project documentation serves as a comprehensive record of all the key decisions made throughout the project lifecycle. 

You can also have a [Table view](https://github.com/orgs/24-S1-2-C-Moral-Decisions/projects/3) of the decisions we have made

## Template
Please follow the template provided in [Decision Log Template.md](DecisionLogTemplate.md) for all decision logs to maintain consistency.
