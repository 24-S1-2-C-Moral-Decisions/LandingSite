# DECISION LOG 
## Decision Details 
- Date: 27 March 2024
- Decision Maker: All team members and the client
  
## Background 
In our quest to improve user engagement and enhance the overall user experience on our platform, the design team recognized the need for a more dynamic and engaging Entry Page scenario. The previous scenario was deemed insufficiently generic, prompting us to seek advice from psychologists. 

## Decision Options 

- **Option 1**: Using post: AITA for buying a Watch instead using that money to pay my gfâ€™s medical bill?
- **Option 2**: Using new post: AITA for calling my fat friend fat after she called me a twig?

## Decision Rationale 
Based on client and psychologist recommendations, we have decided to introduce a new scenario that centers around a relatable and thought-provoking situation: the dilemma of whether to call a friend fat after they have referred to you as a twig. This scenario was chosen for its potential to resonate with a wide audience and stimulate meaningful reflection among users.

## Decision Outcome 
The final decision was to proceed with **Option 2**, using the new post: "AITA for calling my fat friend fat after she called me a twig?" This decision aligns with our goal of enhancing user engagement and improving the overall user experience on our platform by introducing a more relatable and thought-provoking scenario.

## Implementation Plan 

The new game scenario for the Entry Page will be implemented starting with the prototype design team, who will be tasked with delivering an initial draft within two weeks. This phase will focus on creating a comprehensive draft to present to the rest of the team and clients for feedback.

Once the final design is approved by all stakeholders, the web development team will commence the development phase.

## Risks and Mitigation 

- **Risk**: The prototype design phase may be prolonged due to the complexity of integrating dynamic elements, which could lead to delays in the project timeline.
- **Mitigation**: To mitigate this risk, we will implement agile design methodologies to enable rapid iteration based on feedback.

## Follow-up Actions 

- **Prototype Design Team**: Complete the initial draft within two weeks and prepare it for presentation to the team and clients.
- **All Team Members and Clients**: Provide feedback on the draft to guide further iterations.
- **Web Development Team**: Prepare for the development phase following final design approval, ensuring all necessary tools and resources are in place.

## Conclusion 

To enhance user engagement and improve the overall user experience, our design team revamped the Entry Page scenario after recognizing the inadequacy of the previous one. Seeking guidance from psychologists, we ensured our new approach resonates with our audience. We chose to introduce a new scenario focused on the dilemma of whether to call a friend fat after they have referred to you as a twig. This decision aims to create a more relatable and thought-provoking experience, stimulating meaningful reflection and engagement.
