# DECISION LOG

## Decision Details
- Date: March 20, 2024
- Decision Maker: All team members

## Background
A user-friendly, engaging, and data-driven design pattern is essential for encouraging user participation and ensuring the quality of data collected. The project has reached the phase where a decision must be made on the design pattern that will be used for the survey website interface.

## Decision Options
- **Minimalist Design**: A clean, distraction-free layout focusing on content and usability.
- **Z-Pattern Design**: A format that follows the natural eye movement of users to create a visually intuitive experience.
- **F-Pattern Design**: A layout that aligns with the common reading pattern of users, ideal for text-heavy pages.
- **Card-Based Design**: A modular approach that organizes different topics or questions into cards, making the interface scalable and flexible.

## Decision Rationale
The choice of design pattern required a balance between aesthetic appeal and functional simplicity. User engagement metrics, psychological impact on user experience, ease of navigation, and adaptability to various content types were all considered. The team reviewed current design trends to better understand different options.

## Decision Outcome
The team decided to adopt the **Card-Based Design** pattern. This decision was made considering the modular nature of the design, which allows for a better organization of multiple survey questions. It facilitates user engagement by providing a clear path for interaction and the flexibility to expand or adjust the survey content as needed. The card-based approach also integrates well with mobile and desktop platforms, maintaining responsiveness and accessibility standards.

## Implementation Plan
- **Weeks 3-5**: Develop and test card-based design prototypes.
- **Responsible Parties**: Xuan Liu and Shiying Cai lead the UI/UX design, Ceming Fu, and Zhongzheng Huang support with front-end development.
- **Resources**: Design software subscriptions, user testing tools.

## Risks and Mitigation
- **User Overwhelm**: Too many cards could overwhelm users. **Mitigation**: Limit the number of cards per page and provide a clear progression.
- **Design Inconsistency**: Risk of inconsistent designs across different sections. **Mitigation**: Develop a strict style guide and perform regular design reviews.

## Follow-up Actions
- **Client Feedback Sessions**: Conduct bi-weekly feedback sessions to refine the design based on client's feedback.
- **Design Review Meetings**: Hold weekly meetings to review design consistency and adherence to the style guide.

## Conclusion
Adopting the card-based design pattern is expected to enhance the user experience by presenting survey content in an organized, engaging, and digestible manner. This design choice aligns with the project's goal to facilitate the exploration of moral dilemmas through a user-centric interface, ultimately leading to richer data collection and insights into daily moral decisions.
