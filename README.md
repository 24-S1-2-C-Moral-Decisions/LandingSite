## Project Description
- **Developers:** COMP8715 Computing Project, Australian National University, Australia
- **Background:** In recent years, the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and ethics has emerged as a critical area of research. Projects such as Ask Delphi and the Moral Machine Experiment have made significant strides in understanding how AI can be aligned with human moral values. However, these projects often focus on idealized or extreme moral dilemmas, such as the trolley problem, which may not fully capture the complexity of everyday moral decision-making.

- **Objective:** The "AI + Human Exploration of Daily Moral Decisions" project aims to bridge this gap by focusing on the nuances of everyday moral dilemmas. By leveraging AI and human collaboration, the project seeks to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how people navigate moral decisions in their daily lives. The project will involve the development of an interactive Moral Profile Website, which will assist humans in appreciating the rich and nuanced aspects of moral life, and a large-scale Opinion Survey Website, including exploring whether individuals are willing to change their opinions under the influence of others.

## Project Management
In managing our web API development project, we faced challenges such as increasing complexity, the need for consistency in development environments, version control requirements, and time and resource constraints. To address these, we made the following decisions:

- Use Git as our version control system to facilitate collaboration and prevent conflicts.
- Utilize development environments like Visual Studio and WebStorm to ensure uniformity across the team and prevent inconsistencies.
- Use Postman for testing to ensure the code's reliability and effectiveness.
- Chose Jira for [task management](https://moral-decisions.atlassian.net/issues), the Jira [Kanban workflow](https://moral-decisions.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/SCRUM/boards/1), and the Jira [timeline](https://moral-decisions.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/SCRUM/boards/1/timeline) for our development process, aiming for seamless integration, simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and enhanced collaboration within the team.
  - You can use account: `vincenttttwu@gmail.com` and password `MoralTeam` to access the Jira
- Chose Jira for task management, aiming for seamless integration, simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and enhanced collaboration within the team.
- Use agile project management as well as agile development methods. We expect to set a weekly development cycle. Synchronization of tasks and progress at each stage of the development cycle will be determined through frequently scheduled stand-ups meeting, and tasks for the next stage or cycle will be decided.
- We meet with our clients once a week at a set time to synchronize current project progress and to consult with them on issues. The meeting agenda is sent to the client in advance of the meeting.


By focusing on integration, simplicity, and collaboration, we've positioned our team to work with greater agility and transparency, aligning our tooling and workflows with the specific needs and goals of our project. The full decision log can be accessed [here](DecisionLogs/ToolsforProjectManagement.md).

### Risk Management

#### Risk Identification

Make the most of every team station meeting, synchronized meetings with clients, and meetings with tutors to communicate positively. Encourage team members to actively raise possible risks.

#### Risk Evaluation

Utilize weekly station meetings to perform qualitative and quantitative assessments of identified risks, including assessing the probability and impact level of the risk. Risks are prioritized based on their level of impact.

#### Risk Response

Develop response strategies for each risk, including avoidance, transfer, mitigation, and acceptance. Ensure that the response strategy is aligned with project objectives and stakeholder expectations.

Incorporate risk response strategies into project plans and implementation. Ensure that team members have the skills and resources to address the corresponding risks.

#### Documentation and records

Document all identified risks, assessments, response strategies, and implementation processes.


### Conflict Resolution Protocol
- **Purpose:**
<p>The purpose of this document is to outline a well-defined protocol for handling conflicts within our development team. This protocol is intended to ensure that disagreements and issues are resolved efficiently and effectively, allowing us to maintain a healthy and collaborative work environment while focusing on the completion of our APP design and testing tasks.</p>

- **Protocol:**
  - **Identifying the Conflict:**
    <p>Team members should openly and respectfully communicate any concerns or disagreements that arise during the course of the project. This may be done in-person, through 
    video calls, or other appropriate communication channels.
    Conflicts should be brought up as soon as possible to prevent escalation and to ensure timely resolution.</p>
  - **Open Discussion:**
    <p>Once a conflict has been identified, all parties involved should engage in an open discussion to better understand the root cause of the issue.</p>
    <p>Each team member involved should have the opportunity to express their perspective and concerns without interruption.
    Have group meeting twice a week on Wednesday(on-campus) and Sunday(on-line).</p >
    <p>Active listening should be practiced by all participants, ensuring that everyone's viewpoint is heard and understood.</p>
  - **Brainstorming Solutions:**
    <p>After all parties have had a chance to express their concerns, the group should brainstorm potential solutions to the conflict.</p>
    <p>Team members are encouraged to offer suggestions and ideas, no matter how unconventional they may seem.</p>
    <p>The team should aim for a consensus-based solution, where all parties involved are in agreement.</p>

#### Future Improvements
Considering future improvements and continuous optimization is crucial when developing a project. While our goal is to deliver a high-quality product at the current stage, we recognize that technology and market conditions are constantly changing. Therefore, we are willing to invest time and effort in thinking and planning for future enhancements.

In the initial phase of project development, our focus is on implementing core features and meeting basic requirements. However, we also understand that this is just the beginning, and we look forward to continuing to improve and refine the product after delivery.

Our team will also maintain an open and flexible attitude. As the project progresses, we are ready to make adjustments and optimizations based on real-world conditions. We deeply understand that project development is an ongoing iterative process, not a one-time task.

In the [future work document (TODO)](FutureImprovements/), we have listed a continuous feature roadmap for accomplishing future objectives. These functionalities represent our team's vision and mission, serving as the guiding direction and goals for our progress.


During the implementation of these features, we will also prioritize team cohesion and effective communication. We will actively explore new solutions and ideas, conducting experiments and testing to ensure the stability and reliability of the functionalities. Additionally, we will focus on enhancing the user experience to ensure our product truly meets the needs of our users.
