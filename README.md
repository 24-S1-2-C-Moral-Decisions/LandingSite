## Project Description
- **Developers:** COMP8715 Computing Project, Australian National University, Australia
- **Background:** Projects like Ask Delphi (Jiang et al., 2021) are to empower AI with moral decision-making capabilities. Despite its innovation, aligning AI's ethical reasoning with human values remains a significant hurdle, particularly in controversial issues. Another project starting from the human perspective, the MIT lab's Moral Machine Experiment published in Nature, analysed millions of human moral decisions in stark and idealized moral dilemmas, especially trolley problems. However, the nuances of everyday moral dilemmas are overlooked and hard to capture. Our project sits between the two above projects with both humans and AI involved to explore daily moral decision-makings.
- **Objective:** Our project dives into everyday moral dilemmas to understand large-scale human moral decisions. We combine questions and comments from moral decision-making related channels in redits with a variety of AI models to analyze the decisions people make to get. We visualize the results and allow users to interact with the data. We also attract users to fill out our questionnaires to get more data to improve our system and support our clients' research.

## Project Management
In managing our web API development project, we faced challenges such as increasing complexity, the need for consistency in development environments, version control requirements, and time and resource constraints. To address these, we made the following decisions:

- Use Git as our version control system to facilitate collaboration and prevent conflicts.
- Utilize development environments like Visual Studio and WebStorm to ensure uniformity across the team and prevent inconsistencies.
- Use Postman for testing to ensure the code's reliability and effectiveness.
- (May be Jira) Chose GitHub Projects for [task management](https://github.com/24-S1-2-C-Moral-Decisions/LandingSite/issues), the GitHub [Kanban workflow](https://github.com/orgs/24-S1-2-C-Moral-Decisions/projects/2/views/3), and the GitHub [timeline](https://github.com/orgs/24-S1-2-C-Moral-Decisions/projects/2/views/2) for our development process, aiming for seamless integration, simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and enhanced collaboration within the team.
- (May Not) Organize weekly catch-up meetings for code review before merging into the main branch to maintain code quality, ensuring that the code is readable, maintainable, efficient, and error-free.

By focusing on integration, simplicity, and collaboration, we've positioned our team to work with greater agility and transparency, aligning our tooling and workflows with the specific needs and goals of our project. The full decision log can be accessed [here (TODO)](DecisionLogs/ToolsforProjectManagement.md).


## Team Charter
This [document (TODO)](TeamCharter/TeamCharter.md) elaborates on the team's goals, structure, duties, norms, and protocols. It sets a clear direction and delineation for the team, aiding members in fostering mutual expectations and consensus. The primary aim of the team charter is to enhance team efficiency, bolster collaboration, and reduce misunderstandings and potential conflicts.

## Decision Logs
The Decision Log System is a tool designed to track and manage decisions made within a project or organization. By logging decisions, including the context, rationale, options considered, and outcomes, teams can improve transparency, responsibility, and learning. This [Decision Logs](DecisionLogs/) of our project documentation serves as a comprehensive record of all the key decisions made throughout the project lifecycle. 

## Conflict Resolution Protocol
- **Purpose:**
<p>The purpose of this document is to outline a well-defined protocol for handling conflicts within our development team. This protocol is intended to ensure that disagreements and issues are resolved efficiently and effectively, allowing us to maintain a healthy and collaborative work environment while focusing on the completion of our APP design and testing tasks.</p>

- **Protocol:**
  - **Identifying the Conflict:**
    <p>Team members should openly and respectfully communicate any concerns or disagreements that arise during the course of the project. This may be done in-person, through 
    video calls, or other appropriate communication channels.
    Conflicts should be brought up as soon as possible to prevent escalation and to ensure timely resolution.</p>
  - **Open Discussion:**
    <p>Once a conflict has been identified, all parties involved should engage in an open discussion to better understand the root cause of the issue.</p>
    <p>Each team member involved should have the opportunity to express their perspective and concerns without interruption.
    Have group meeting twice a week on Wednesday(on-campus) and Sunday(on-line).</p >
    <p>Active listening should be practiced by all participants, ensuring that everyone's viewpoint is heard and understood.</p>
  - **Brainstorming Solutions:**
    <p>After all parties have had a chance to express their concerns, the group should brainstorm potential solutions to the conflict.</p>
    <p>Team members are encouraged to offer suggestions and ideas, no matter how unconventional they may seem.</p>
    <p>The team should aim for a consensus-based solution, where all parties involved are in agreement.</p>

## Future Improvements
Considering future improvements and continuous optimization is crucial when developing a project. While our goal is to deliver a high-quality product at the current stage, we recognize that technology and market conditions are constantly changing. Therefore, we are willing to invest time and effort in thinking and planning for future enhancements.

In the initial phase of project development, our focus is on implementing core features and meeting basic requirements. However, we also understand that this is just the beginning, and we look forward to continuing to improve and refine the product after delivery.

Our team will also maintain an open and flexible attitude. As the project progresses, we are ready to make adjustments and optimizations based on real-world conditions. We deeply understand that project development is an ongoing iterative process, not a one-time task.

In the [future work document (TODO)](FutureImprovements/), we have listed a continuous feature roadmap for accomplishing future objectives. These functionalities represent our team's vision and mission, serving as the guiding direction and goals for our progress.


During the implementation of these features, we will also prioritize team cohesion and effective communication. We will actively explore new solutions and ideas, conducting experiments and testing to ensure the stability and reliability of the functionalities. Additionally, we will focus on enhancing the user experience to ensure our product truly meets the needs of our users.
