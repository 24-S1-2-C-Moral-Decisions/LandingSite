# Planning and Organization Logs
## Planning Details 
- Date: 11/03/2025
- Decision Maker: All members
  
## Background 
During this week's meeting, both the team and the client raised suggestions to improve the user experience of the frontend pages. The primary issues include:

- Inconsistent frontend styles (differences in fonts, sizes, margins, etc.)
- Compatibility issues with page display on screens of varying sizes

To address these issues, ensure that pages display well on various devices, and enhance overall user experience, the team decided to discuss and make a decision regarding standardizing frontend styles and implementing responsive design.

## Planning Options 
- **Option 1:** Maintain the existing method of managing frontend styles and address each display issue individually.
- **Option 2:** Establish a unified frontend style guide and adopt a mature responsive CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap) to standardize page appearance and layout.
- **Option 3:** Implement responsive design using custom CSS media queries and handcrafted styles without introducing a new framework.

## Planning Rationale 
After evaluation, We concluded:

- **Option 1** lacks a systematic approach and cannot ensure consistent styles across all pages, leading to high long-term maintenance costs;
- **Option 3** might meet some requirements, but completely custom development is labor-intensive and prone to errors;
- **Option 2** leverages an established responsive framework that quickly achieves a uniform style and multi-device compatibility while reducing future maintenance efforts.

Therefore, the final decision is to adopt **Option 2**.

## Planning Outcome 
It is decided to develop a unified frontend style guide and select a responsive CSS framework to ensure that pages have a consistent visual appearance and deliver a good user experience across different screen sizes.

## Implementation Plan
**Timeline:** Initiate immediately, with the goal of completing an initial implementation within two weeks.

**Responsibilities:**

- **UI/UX Designer:** Responsible for creating the unified frontend style guide (including standards for fonts, margins, colors, etc.).
- **Frontend Developers:** Evaluate and integrate the chosen responsive CSS framework and adjust existing pages accordingly.

**Action Steps:**

1. Evaluate and choose an appropriate responsive CSS framework;
2. Develop and publish the unified frontend style guide;
3. Adjust current frontend pages and perform testing across different devices.

## Risks and Mitigation

- Risk: A temporary inconsistency in UI may occur during the transition period.

   - **Mitigation:** Maintain a test version concurrently and deploy updates in phases to ensure a smooth transition.

- Risk: The learning curve associated with the new framework for team members.

   - **Mitigation:** Organize training sessions and internal workshops, and provide detailed documentation and support materials.

## Follow-up Actions
1. Hold a review meeting two weeks later to assess implementation progress and gather user feedback;
2. Adjust the frontend style guide and implementation plan based on the feedback;
3. Update all relevant project documentation to ensure all team members are aligned with the new standards.

## Conclusion
By standardizing the frontend styles and adopting a responsive CSS framework, this decision will improve the display performance on various devices, enhance the user experience, and reduce long-term maintenance costs. This solution meets the client's requirements while providing strong support for efficient team collaboration and overall project quality.
