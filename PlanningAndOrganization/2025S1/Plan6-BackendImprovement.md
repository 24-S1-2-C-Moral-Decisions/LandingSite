# Planning and Organization Logs
## Planning Details
- Date: 17/04/2025
- Decision Maker: All 7 team members

## Background
Following the implementation of Nectar, our team identified several backend issues affecting system performance and deployment efficiency. Key challenges included:

- Backend performance bottlenecks impacting overall system responsiveness
- Inconsistent server connectivity causing development and testing delays
- Deployment address configuration problems for individual team members during production releases

To resolve these issues and improve the development-to-production pipeline, the team decided to implement backend optimizations and standardize the deployment process.

## Planning Options
- **Option 1:** Individual solutions - Have each team member resolve connectivity and deployment issues independently.
- **Option 2:** Comprehensive backend overhaul - Completely redesign the backend architecture and deployment pipeline.
- **Option 3:** Targeted optimization - Focus on specific backend performance issues and standardize deployment configurations.

## Planning Rationale
After team discussion, we concluded:

- **Option 1** would result in inconsistent solutions and fail to address systemic issues;
- **Option 2** would require excessive time and resources while disrupting ongoing development;
- **Option 3** allows us to address critical issues efficiently without major disruption.

Therefore, the final decision is to adopt **Option 3**.

## Planning Outcome
We will implement targeted backend optimizations, establish reliable server connectivity, and create a standardized deployment configuration system that resolves address issues for all team members.

## Implementation Plan
**Timeline:** 18/04/2025 - 28/04/2025

**Responsibilities:**
- **Backend Developers:** Implement performance optimizations and connectivity solutions
- **DevOps Specialist:** Configure server environments and standardize deployment process
- **Team Members:** Test deployment using new standardized configurations

**Action Steps:**
1. Optimize critical backend services and database queries
2. Establish reliable server connectivity with redundancy measures 
3. Implement standardized deployment configuration system resolving address issues 

## Risks and Mitigation
- Risk: Service interruptions during backend modifications
  - **Mitigation:** Schedule changes during off-peak hours and implement gradual rollout with fallback options

- Risk: New deployment process might require additional learning
  - **Mitigation:** Create comprehensive documentation and conduct hands-on training session

## Follow-up Actions
1. Monitor backend performance metrics after optimization (Backend Team)
2. Verify deployment success rate across all team members
3. Document standardized server connection and deployment procedures

## Conclusion
These backend optimizations and deployment standardizations will significantly improve our development workflow efficiency. By establishing consistent server connectivity and resolving deployment address issues for each team member, we will reduce deployment failures and accelerate the release cycle. These improvements complement our recent Nectar implementation, creating a more robust and efficient development environment.
