## Reflection Logs

Date: 17/03/2025

### Overall Progress Overview

In this Sprint, the Azure deployment work was completed as planned, and the backend services were successfully migrated to the Azure platform, which greatly improved the scalability and stability of the system. User story writing helped the team better understand and capture user needs. In addition, we also completed the creation of the front-end development environment setup guide, providing a clear environment configuration process for new team members.

### Analysis of Successful Experiences

We conducted a detailed task decomposition and dependency analysis before the start of the Sprint, clarified the prerequisites and subsequent impacts of each task, and made the task execution sequence more reasonable. For example, we prioritized the completion of the Azure deployment and environment configuration guide. By letting customers decide the priority of user stories, the team's demand analysis capabilities are improved, and communication and understanding with the business side are strengthened, making subsequent development closer to the actual needs of users.

### Challenges

- Team members adapted to the newly introduced deployment environment at different speeds
- We underestimated the difficulty of integrating various modules to present a complete solution
- The development of questionnaire-related functions faces design challenges, especially in ensuring a smooth user experience while meeting complex data collection requirements

### Improvement strategy

Focus on learning cloud technology and new frameworks. Let Zhenhao Li help other members accelerate the mastery of new technologies. For customer technical solution demonstrations, plan the required functional points and integration tests in advance, and plan to conduct more detailed user experience research, collect actual user feedback and conduct prototype testing to ensure that the design meets actual needs.

### Next Steps

Advance the development of the questionnaire website, especially the implementation of the version control function, with the goal of completing all functional development and preliminary testing before the end of the next cycle. Re-evaluate all tasks currently in progress to ensure that core functions are delivered on time and avoid underestimating the difficulty of tasks.
