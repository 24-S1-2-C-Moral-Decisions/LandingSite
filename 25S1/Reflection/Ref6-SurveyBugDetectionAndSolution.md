### Overall Progress Overview

During this sprint, we successfully identified and resolved the synchronization issues in the survey module that emerged after migrating data from posts. The team implemented a hybrid solution combining WebSocket technology with enhanced backend data handling. This fix has significantly improved data consistency across different survey pages and components. All team members worked collaboratively to diagnose the root causes and develop a comprehensive solution that addressed both immediate user experience concerns and underlying data integrity issues.

### Analysis of Successful Experiences

Our approach of forming a cross-functional task force with both frontend and backend developers proved highly effective. By having both perspectives represented, we were able to quickly identify that the synchronization issues stemmed from both client-side state management problems and backend data delivery inconsistencies. The decision to implement WebSockets for real-time updates was particularly successful, as it provided immediate feedback to users while maintaining system performance. Breaking down the fix into distinct phases (infrastructure setup, backend enhancement, and frontend integration) allowed us to track progress clearly and identify bottlenecks early.

### Challenges

- Initial confusion about the scope of the synchronization issue, as it manifested differently across various survey components
- Performance concerns when implementing WebSockets at scale, particularly with concurrent users
- Integration complexity between the new synchronization mechanism and existing survey page components
- Balancing the need for immediate fixes with developing a sustainable long-term solution
- Testing was challenging as the bug was intermittent and difficult to reproduce consistently

### Improvement strategy

To improve our handling of similar issues in the future, we will implement more comprehensive monitoring tools specifically designed to detect data synchronization problems. We plan to enhance our automated testing suite to include scenarios that test data consistency across different components. Documentation of the survey module's architecture will be updated to include detailed information about data flow and synchronization mechanisms. Additionally, we will organize knowledge-sharing sessions where team members who worked on this fix can explain the solution to others, ensuring the entire team understands the synchronization architecture.

### Next Steps

Implement a monitoring dashboard specifically for tracking survey module performance and synchronization issues. Complete a full review of similar components in other modules to proactively identify potential synchronization problems. Refine the WebSocket implementation to further optimize performance and handle edge cases. Prepare comprehensive documentation about the new synchronization architecture for future reference. Finally, collect additional user feedback to verify that the synchronization issues are fully resolved across all use cases and scenarios.
