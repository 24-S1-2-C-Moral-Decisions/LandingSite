## Reflection Logs

Date: 18/03/2025

### Overall Progress Overview

During this Sprint, the team made significant progress and successfully completed a number of key tasks. We completed the Azure platform backend service migration as planned, completed the work statement for Term 1, 2025, and made breakthroughs in technical documentation, including the creation of project architecture design decision documents and development environment setup guides. At the same time, we also achieved results in the development and testing of game pages, automatic generation of API documentation configuration, and modification of CI/CD environments.

### Analysis of Successful Experiences

The success of this Sprint is mainly reflected in several aspects. First, the improvement of technical documentation plays a fundamental supporting role in the entire project. From project architecture design to development environment setup guides, to automatic generation of API documentation configuration, these documents not only standardize the development process, but also provide clear guidance for new members. Secondly, the progress we have made in the migration of the Azure platform shows that the team has a deeper understanding and mastery of cloud service technology. Finally, the completion of the development and testing of game-related pages demonstrates the team's professional capabilities in front-end development.

### Challenges

Although progress has been smooth, we have also faced some challenges. From the completed task list, it can be seen that "inefficient team communication and collaboration" and "steep learning curve of the technology stack leading to development delays" are two clearly identified problems. This shows that there is still room for improvement in the team's collaboration methods and technology adaptation. In addition, multiple tasks related to the questionnaire are still in progress, indicating that this part of the work may be more complicated than expected or require more coordination.

### Improvement strategy

For the problems found, we propose the following improvement strategies:

- Strengthen the team communication mechanism and introduce daily short stand-up meetings to ensure information synchronization and timely problem resolution. It is recommended to use collaborative tools to enhance asynchronous communication and reduce information islands.
- For the problem of steep learning curve of the technology stack, it is recommended to organize regular knowledge sharing meetings for team members familiar with specific technologies to share and train. At the same time, establish a technical document library to record solutions and common problems to reduce the cost of repeated learning.
- For tasks related to the questionnaire, it is recommended to conduct more detailed task decomposition, clarify the dependencies and priorities of each subtask, and avoid affecting the overall progress due to the delay of one link.
- Adjust the task estimation method to more accurately evaluate the difficulty and time required for the task based on the actual completion of this Sprint, and avoid overly optimistic or pessimistic estimates.

### Next Steps

Looking ahead to the next Sprint, we plan to focus on solving the ongoing survey-related tasks, especially the two tasks of "customer-made public surveys" and "understanding research concepts and findings". At the same time, we will invest resources to solve the problems of team communication and collaboration efficiency, as well as the challenges brought by the technology stack learning curve.
We will also re-evaluate task priorities to ensure that tasks on the critical path are supported by sufficient resources, and provide necessary technical support and training to team members to improve overall execution efficiency.
