### Overall Progress Overview

During this sprint, we successfully identified and resolved the critical synchronization issues in our backend API regarding question quantities. The team implemented an event-driven architecture using a message queue system to ensure consistent reporting of question counts across all services. This solution has significantly improved data reliability for reporting functions, analytics dashboards, and user-facing displays. The implementation effectively addressed the inconsistencies that emerged after our recent system scaling efforts that distributed our question database across multiple services. All team members collaborated effectively across backend architecture, API development, and database teams to diagnose the root causes and develop a comprehensive solution that addressed both immediate data consistency concerns and underlying architectural issues.

### Analysis of Successful Experiences

Our approach of establishing a dedicated task force with representatives from architecture, development, and database teams proved highly effective. By bringing together these diverse perspectives, we quickly identified that the synchronization issues stemmed from both distributed data storage patterns and inconsistent counting methodologies across services. The decision to implement an event-driven architecture with a message queue system was particularly successful, as it provided a scalable solution that maintained service independence while ensuring count consistency. Breaking down the implementation into manageable phases (message queue infrastructure setup, event schema definition, service modifications, and reconciliation process development) allowed us to make steady progress and identify potential issues early in the process.

### Challenges

- Initial difficulty in pinpointing all instances where question count inconsistencies occurred across different services
- Ensuring reliable message delivery in the queue system, particularly during high traffic periods
- Managing the complexity of event handling across multiple consumer services with different processing speeds
- Balancing the need for immediate count consistency with system performance considerations
- Creating comprehensive test scenarios that could reliably reproduce the synchronization issues in development environments
- Coordinating deployment across multiple services to minimize transition period inconsistencies

### Improvement strategy

To improve our handling of similar issues in the future, we will implement more robust monitoring tools specifically designed to detect data synchronization discrepancies across distributed services. We plan to enhance our service architecture documentation to explicitly define data ownership and synchronization patterns from the outset of new feature development. Additionally, we will develop a standardized approach to event-driven synchronization that can be applied to other data consistency challenges across our platform. Regular architecture reviews will be scheduled to proactively identify potential synchronization issues before they affect production systems. We will also enhance our automated testing suite to include verification of data consistency across distributed services.

### Next Steps

Implement comprehensive monitoring dashboards specifically for tracking message queue health and data consistency metrics. Extend the event-driven synchronization pattern to other critical data points beyond question counts. Optimize the message queue configuration for improved performance and reliability. Conduct a full review of our distributed data storage approach to identify other potential synchronization vulnerabilities. Prepare detailed documentation about the event-driven architecture and synchronization patterns for developer reference. Finally, collect system performance metrics to ensure the new synchronization mechanism does not negatively impact overall system performance under various load conditions.
