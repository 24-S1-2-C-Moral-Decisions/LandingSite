## **Developer Perspective**

Zhang, the lead full-stack developer of the project, receives repeated feedback from users about broken layouts on mobile devices. After thorough testing across various screen sizes, he identifies compatibility issues with older Android browsers. He quickly reworks the responsive layout using Bootstrap 5 to ensure consistent UI across all devices. At the same time, he notices that the Nectar Cloud bill is skyrocketing. By analyzing storage and bandwidth logs, he discovers that static survey data wasn’t being cached. He implements CDN caching and sets appropriate expiration headers, cutting costs by nearly 40%. As the tech steward of the platform, Zhang focuses on delivering smooth user experience, cross-device stability, and long-term operational efficiency — all supported by these core features.

## **Client Perspective**

Mr. Li, the project sponsor and business lead at a psychology institute, wants the site to attract not only general users but also research partners. After reviewing early usage reports, he proposes adding a “Research Purpose Introduction” to the landing page to explain the intent and values behind the test. He also requests a feature to support A/B testing by creating separate versions of the survey for control and treatment groups. To promote the platform externally, he asks the development team to publish a public demo site for easy sharing. During a partnership discussion with university collaborators, he easily exports anonymized raw survey data, gaining recognition for the site’s research readiness. For Mr. Li, these features help bridge research integrity, business scalability, and public credibility.
