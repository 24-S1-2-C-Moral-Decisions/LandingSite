## Project Description
**Developers:** COMP8715 Computing Project, Australian National University, Australia

**Background:** In recent years, the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and ethics has become a crucial area of research. While projects like Ask Delphi and the Moral Machine Experiment have made strides in understanding AI's alignment with human moral values, they often focus on idealized or extreme scenarios. This project seeks to explore everyday moral dilemmas through AI and human collaboration.

**Objective:** The "AI + Human Exploration of Daily Moral Decisions" project aims to develop an interactive Moral Profile Website to explore the nuances of daily moral decision-making, and an Opinion Survey Website to analyze whether individuals change their opinions under external influences.
