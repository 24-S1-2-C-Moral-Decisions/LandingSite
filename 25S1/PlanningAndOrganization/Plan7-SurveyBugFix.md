# Planning and Organization Logs
## Planning Details
- Date: 14/04/2025
- Decision Maker: Development Team

## Background
Our team has identified a critical synchronization issue in the survey module following the data migration from posts. Users are experiencing inconsistent data display across different survey pages, with changes made in one section not properly reflecting in others. This synchronization bug is causing confusion for users and potentially compromising data integrity. With the recent migration of data from posts to survey, resolving this synchronization issue has become a high priority.

## Planning Options
- **Option 1:** Client-side fix - Implement front-end polling and state management to force data synchronization.
- **Option 2:** Server-side solution - Modify the backend API to ensure consistent data delivery across all survey components.
- **Option 3:** Hybrid approach - Implement real-time synchronization using WebSockets combined with improved backend data handling.

## Planning Rationale
After analyzing the synchronization issues, we concluded:

- **Option 1** offers quick implementation but may increase client-side overhead and wouldn't resolve underlying data consistency issues;
- **Option 2** addresses root causes but might not provide the immediate responsiveness that users expect;
- **Option 3** provides both data consistency and real-time user experience but requires more development effort.

Therefore, the final decision is to adopt **Option 3**.

## Planning Outcome
We will implement a hybrid solution that combines WebSocket technology for real-time updates with enhanced backend data handling to ensure survey page synchronization across the application.

## Implementation Plan
**Timeline:** 14/04/2025 - 22/04/2025

**Responsibilities:**
- **Backend Developers:** Implement API enhancements and WebSocket server functionality
- **Frontend Developers:** Integrate WebSocket clients and update survey components
- **QA Team:** Design test cases specifically for synchronization scenarios

**Action Steps:**
1. Establish WebSocket infrastructure and synchronization protocol
2. Enhance backend data handling to ensure consistent state
3. Implement front-end components for real-time updates

## Risks and Mitigation
- Risk: WebSocket implementation may impact system performance
  - **Mitigation:** Implement connection pooling and optimize message payload size

- Risk: Synchronization conflicts during concurrent edits
  - **Mitigation:** Develop conflict resolution strategy and appropriate user notifications

## Follow-up Actions
1. Monitor system performance with new synchronization mechanism
2. Collect user feedback on synchronization improvements
3. Document the synchronization architecture for future maintenance

## Conclusion
Fixing the survey page synchronization issue is critical for maintaining data integrity and user trust following our migration from posts to survey. The hybrid approach will provide both immediate user feedback and consistent data representation, significantly improving the survey module's reliability and usability. These improvements align with our broader goals of system modernization and enhanced user experience.
