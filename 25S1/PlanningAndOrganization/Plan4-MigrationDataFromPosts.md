# Planning and Organization Logs
## Planning Details
- Date: 01/04/2025
- Decision Maker: Zhenhao Li, Shutong Li

## Background
Our current system stores user feedback and data primarily in the posts module. As business requirements have evolved and system functionality expanded, we need to migrate this data to a purpose-built survey module for better analysis and utilization. The posts module was not originally designed for collecting structured survey data, creating limitations in data analysis and report generation.

## Planning Options
- **Option 1:** Partial migration - Transfer only key data from posts to the survey system, keeping historical data in the original system.
- **Option 2:** Full migration - Move all posts data to the new survey system, completely abandoning the original data storage.
- **Option 3:** Phased migration - Migrate data incrementally by priority, ensuring system stability and business continuity.

## Planning Rationale
After thorough assessment, we concluded:

- **Option 1** preserves historical data but creates a fragmented data environment requiring dual system maintenance;
- **Option 2** offers a clean transition but presents high risk and potential business disruption;
- **Option 3** balances risk management with operational needs by prioritizing recent data while ensuring a complete transition over time.

Therefore, the final decision is to adopt **Option 3**.

## Planning Outcome
We will implement a phased migration strategy, transferring data from posts to the survey system based on data importance and business priorities. Recent active data (last 90 days) will be migrated first, followed by historical data.

## Implementation Plan
**Timeline:** 01/04/2025 - 14/04/2025

**Responsibilities:**
- **Data Engineers:** Responsible for data mapping and migration script development
- **QA Team:** Verify data integrity and functionality
- **Frontend Developers:** Update application interfaces to read from new data sources

**Action Steps:**
1. Complete data mapping design and develop migration scripts
2. Migrate recent active data and perform validation
3. Transfer remaining historical data and implement archiving strategy

## Risks and Mitigation
- Risk: Data loss during transfer
  - **Mitigation:** Perform complete backups, design rollback mechanisms, establish data validation processes

- Risk: System performance degradation
  - **Mitigation:** Execute migration during off-peak hours, optimize query performance, monitor system load

## Follow-up Actions
1. Monitor system performance and user feedback (System Operations Team, ongoing)
2. Develop retirement plan for the posts module (Project Manager)

## Conclusion
This data migration represents a key step in our system modernization strategy. The phased approach will minimize business disruption while ensuring data integrity and availability. This migration will enable better collection, analysis, and utilization of user feedback data, improving the quality and responsiveness of product decisions.
