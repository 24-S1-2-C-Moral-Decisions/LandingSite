# Planning and Organization Logs
## Planning Details
- Date: 28/04/2025
- Decision Maker: Backend Development Team

## Background
Our team has identified a critical synchronization issue in our backend API regarding question quantities. Currently, different API endpoints are reporting inconsistent numbers of questions across our system. This inconsistency is causing data reliability problems for reporting functions, analytics dashboards, and user-facing displays. The discrepancy appears after recent system scaling efforts that distributed our question database across multiple services. Resolving this question count synchronization issue has become a high priority to ensure data integrity across the platform.

## Planning Options
- **Option 1:** Centralized Counter - Implement a dedicated microservice responsible for tracking and providing the authoritative count of questions.
- **Option 2:** Database-level Solution - Modify the database architecture to ensure consistent counting mechanisms across all services.
- **Option 3:** Event-driven Approach - Implement an event sourcing pattern with a message queue system to propagate question count changes across all services.

## Planning Rationale
After analyzing the synchronization issues, we concluded:

- **Option 1** creates a single point of failure and could introduce performance bottlenecks during high traffic periods;
- **Option 2** addresses fundamental issues but requires significant database refactoring that poses migration risks;
- **Option 3** provides better scalability, fault tolerance, and allows services to maintain their independence while ensuring count consistency.

Therefore, the final decision is to adopt **Option 3**.

## Planning Outcome
We will implement an event-driven architecture using a message queue system to propagate question count changes across all services, ensuring consistent reporting of question quantities throughout the platform.

## Implementation Plan
**Timeline:** 29/04/2025 - 09/05/2025

**Responsibilities:**
- **Backend Architects:** Design event schema and message queue infrastructure
- **API Developers:** Modify services to publish and consume question count events
- **Database Team:** Implement atomic operations for question count modifications
- **QA Team:** Create comprehensive test scenarios for synchronization validation

**Action Steps:**
1. Set up message queue infrastructure with appropriate redundancy
2. Define standardized event schema for question count changes
3. Modify services to publish events on question creation, update, and deletion
4. Implement consumers for each service requiring question count data
5. Create reconciliation process for handling missed events and periodic count verification

## Risks and Mitigation
- Risk: Message queue system failure could lead to count inconsistencies
  - **Mitigation:** Implement a fallback reconciliation service that periodically verifies and corrects counts

- Risk: Increased system complexity affecting troubleshooting and maintenance
  - **Mitigation:** Create comprehensive monitoring dashboards and detailed logging of count-related events

- Risk: Temporary inconsistencies during the transition period
  - **Mitigation:** Implement a gradual rollout with parallel systems and verification checks

## Follow-up Actions
1. Monitor question count consistency across all platform services
2. Measure performance impact of the new event-driven architecture
3. Document the synchronization architecture and event patterns for developer reference
4. Create automated tests to verify count consistency as part of the CI/CD pipeline

## Conclusion
Resolving the backend API question count synchronization issue is essential for maintaining data integrity and building trust in our platform's metrics. The event-driven approach will provide a scalable, fault-tolerant solution that accommodates our distributed architecture while ensuring consistent question counts across all services. This improvement aligns with our broader technical strategy of building resilient, decoupled systems that can scale independently while maintaining data consistency.
