### Developer Scenario

Zhang Lei is a full-stack developer responsible for the technical aspects of the psychological test website. One evening, he receives user feedback about slow loading on the mobile version of the test submission page. He uses the browser’s developer tools and finds that uncompressed image assets are causing the delay. The next morning, he optimizes the image files and implements lazy loading to improve performance. Then, he checks the questionnaire logic to ensure that each question behaves correctly based on user selections. During a routine code review, he also enhances user data encryption to meet GDPR compliance and introduces an "anonymous mode" option to further protect user privacy. To ensure scalability, he deploys the backend to a cloud service with elastic scaling and runs tests across multiple devices and browsers to confirm cross-device compatibility. Once the work is done, Zhang writes a technical documentation summary for team reference. His efforts not only solve user-reported issues but also improve the site’s performance, privacy, and long-term stability.

### Client Scenario

Mr. Li is the business director of a psychology institution and the primary sponsor of the project. After the website launches, he closely monitors user registrations and test completion rates on the analytics dashboard. Although user acquisition is on track, he notices low return visits. In a team meeting, he proposes adding features like “email test reminders” and “test recommendation sharing” to boost user engagement. He also analyzes competitors and suggests a monetization strategy: offering paid in-depth analysis for test results. To evaluate business potential, he collaborates with the marketing team to run a “Psychology Test Month” campaign on social media. At the same time, he requests the development team to track user flow to identify drop-off points. As the project decision-maker, Mr. Li is constantly focused on commercial viability, brand credibility, and how to turn user interest into sustainable growth.

### Research User Scenario

Dr. Chen is a psychology researcher at a university lab, focusing on emotion recognition and personality profiling. After testing the website himself, he finds that the questionnaire logic is solid and potentially valuable for academic research. He appreciates that the test results include citations and references, as well as basic reliability and validity data. After contacting the site, he is granted research access, allowing him to download anonymized datasets. Dr. Chen uses these for factor analysis, aiming to validate the questionnaire on a Chinese sample. He also utilizes the site’s “batch test link generation” feature to distribute the test to over 200 participants. Throughout this process, his focus is on the scientific rigor of the test, data accessibility, and user consent. This scenario reflects how the website, if designed well, can serve both casual users and the research community through transparent and ethical data use.
