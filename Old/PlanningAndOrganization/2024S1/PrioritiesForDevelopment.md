# DECISION LOG 
## Decision Details 
- Date: Mar 14
- Decision Maker: [Name or title of the person/ team making the decision]
  
## Background 
In the process of developing a comprehensive web project, the team was faced with multiple concurrent tasks including the design of the homepage prototype, the design of the survey feedback page prototype, the implementation of these prototypes, the design and implementation of frontend and backend API calls, and the utilization of templates to create survey pages. Given the rapid iteration of the homepage prototype, which precluded further development, alongside the efficiency of using templates for survey page creation, a strategic decision was required to determine the prioritization and sequencing of development tasks to optimize workflow and project efficiency.

## Decision Options 
- Option 1: Sequential development starting with prototype designs, followed by API design and implementation, and finally, survey page implementation.
- Option 2: Parallel development of prototype designs and survey page implementation using templates, postponing API calls design and implementation.
- Option 3: Focus on API design and implementation first to establish backend functionality, followed by parallel development of prototypes and survey pages.


## Decision Rationale 
The decision was guided by the need to maintain project momentum while addressing the bottleneck caused by the rapid iteration of the homepage prototype. By analyzing the dependencies between tasks and the potential for parallel development, Option 2 was selected for its ability to:

- Overcome the current standstill in homepage and feedback page prototype development.
- Leverage the simplicity and efficiency of using templates for survey page creation, a task that is less dependent on the completion of prototype designs.
- Allow for the continued progress on aspects of the project that are ready for development, maximizing the use of resources and time.

## Decision Outcome 
The team decided to proceed with Option 2, parallel development of the prototype designs and survey page implementations using templates. This approach acknowledges the current challenges with prototype iteration and capitalizes on the readiness and simplicity of survey page development using existing templates. This decision aims to optimize overall project efficiency without compromising the quality or integrity of the final product.

## Implementation Plan 

1. Continuing the iterative design of the homepage and feedback page prototypes without halting other development processes.
2. Initiating the development of survey pages using templates immediately, assigning this task to a dedicated team or individuals.
3. Scheduling regular check-ins to assess progress on prototype designs and adjust development priorities as necessary.
4. Coordinating between design and development teams to ensure that any changes in prototypes can be efficiently integrated into the survey pages if needed.

## Risks and Mitigation 

- Risk: Potential misalignment between the finalized prototypes and the developed survey pages.
  - Mitigation: Establish a clear communication channel between designers and developers to quickly address and integrate changes or updates.

- Risk: Resource allocation challenges due to parallel development efforts.
  - Mitigation: Prioritize tasks based on current progress and adjust resource allocation dynamically to ensure balanced development efforts.

## Follow-up Actions 

- Regular update meetings to review the progress of prototype designs and survey page development.
- Preparation for integration of prototype designs with survey pages, planning for adjustments as needed based on final designs.
- Continuous evaluation of project priorities and adjustment of the development sequence to address any emerging challenges or opportunities.

## Conclusion 

The decision to proceed with parallel development of prototype designs and survey page implementations reflects a strategic approach to navigating current development challenges while ensuring continuous project progress. By effectively leveraging available resources and adapting to project needs, this decision supports the goal of efficient and flexible project management, ensuring that the project remains on track towards achieving its objectives.
