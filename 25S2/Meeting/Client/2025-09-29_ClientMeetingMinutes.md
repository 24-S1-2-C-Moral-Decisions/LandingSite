It was agreed that a complete set of documentation should be included in the handover package. This includes logic documents (explaining workflows and decision processes), database documents (detailing schema, tables, and data relationships), and architecture documents (showing the systemâ€™s overall design and dependencies).

**Supporting Materials**
Besides written documents, handover should also include practical supporting materials. In particular, video recordings of the deployment process are required. These will help new team members quickly understand how to set up and maintain the system without needing extra guidance.
