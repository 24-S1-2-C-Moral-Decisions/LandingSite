## Background

Following the latest client discussion, the next sprint must clarify and document the Survey UI ↔ Database interaction and deliver a verifiable demo. The client specifically asked for:
1. A complete inventory of all databases, where they are hosted (e.g., MongoDB vs Nectar), and who owns them.
2. Schemas for each database.
3. A step-by-step procedure for modifying survey content and ensuring it persists to the database.
4. A display video showing local run, public access, one survey submission, and a database read/verification.
5. A logic document focused on architecture and relationships across layers (UI → API → backend → DB), not a user manual.

## Planning Options

The team considered the following approaches:

1. Option 1: Work in parallel on DB inventory/schemas, step-by-step guide, logic documentation, demo recording, and delivery plan.
2. Option 2: Sequence the work to reduce context switching and dependency risks: first DB inventory and survey data flow, then step-by-step guide, then logic doc, then demo and delivery plan.

## Planning Rationale

- Option 1 (Parallel Work): Maximizes throughput but risks inconsistencies while fundamentals (DB locations/schemas) are still being clarified.
- Option 2 (Sequential Work): Aligns with client emphasis on “architecture and direct relationships,” minimizing rework and ensuring the demo is grounded on accurate docs.

The team agreed that establishing foundations first is critical before producing the demo and higher-level documents.

## Planning Outcome

Proceed with Option 2 (Sequential Work) in this order:
1. Compile database inventory (locations/hosting, owners) and document schemas.
2. Map and document the end-to-end survey data flow (UI → API → backend → DB) including validation.
3. Write the step-by-step procedure for updating survey content and persisting changes.
4. Draft the Survey Logic Doc (architecture overview, layers, rules, diagrams).
5. Record the display video (local + public) showing submit → store → query.
6. Draft the delivery plan and review with the client to keep only essential items.

## Implementation Plan

1. Database Inventory & Schemas
   - Task: List all databases; specify hosting (MongoDB vs Nectar), endpoints, access, owners; record schemas.
   - Action: Pull details from deployments/config; confirm with owners; create Markdown tables in /docs.
   - Resources: Repo configs, env files, platform dashboards.

2. Survey Data Flow
   - Task: Document request/response, validation, backend handlers, and DB writes/reads.
   - Action: Capture example payloads; trace logs; produce a sequence diagram and component map.
   - Resources: API routes, server logs, Postman/HTTP client.

3. Step-by-step Update Guide
   - Task: Provide an actionable “how to modify survey content” guide.
   - Action: Numbered steps covering content edits, schema/migration updates, API validation, tests, deployment, verification, and rollback.

4. Logic Documentation (Survey)
   - Task: Architecture and logic across layers; business/validation rules; error handling.
   - Action: Write Markdown; add diagrams (PNG/SVG) and link from README.

5. Display Video
   - Task: Demo local run and public URL, submit a survey, verify data in DB, show a simple query/read.
   - Action: Prepare script; ensure environments healthy; record and attach link alongside docs.

6. Delivery Plan
   - Task: Outline the minimal set of handover docs; confirm with client which sections are required.
   - Action: Draft and schedule a review; trim non-essential items.

## Risks and Mitigation

1. Hosting ambiguity (MongoDB vs Nectar) blocks documentation.
   - Mitigation: Assign owner to confirm hosting and credentials on day 1; use placeholders with due dates if pending.

2. Schema changes needed for survey updates cause delays.
   - Mitigation: Include migration path, versioning, and rollback in the step-by-step guide.

3. Public environment instability affects the demo.
   - Mitigation: Add pre-demo health checks, seed data, and a retry/rollback plan.

4. Knowledge gaps for prior changes.
   - Mitigation: Have the previous implementer document the exact steps taken and review with the team.

## Follow-up Actions

1. Confirm DB locations/hosting and access with owners; finalize the inventory and schemas.  
2. Complete the survey data flow and the step-by-step update guide; request internal review.  
3. Draft the Survey Logic Doc and link it from README in /docs.  
4. Record and publish the display video; verify both local and public environments.  
5. Prepare the delivery plan and schedule a client review to finalize the must-have documents.

## Conclusion

This plan prioritizes foundational clarity—database inventory, schemas, and survey data flow—before producing the logic documentation and the display video. Sequencing the work reduces rework, aligns with the client’s emphasis on architecture and end-to-end integrity, and ensures a reliable, verifiable outcome for the sprint.
