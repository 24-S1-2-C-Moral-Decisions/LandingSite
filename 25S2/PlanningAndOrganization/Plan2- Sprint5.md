## Background

In Sprint 4, we successfully connected the new client-provided database. The client was satisfied with this outcome and requested further improvements.
 The next sprint’s work will focus on the following tasks:

1. Fixing frontend navigation: Clicking on a hot post should navigate the user to its detailed view page.
2. Updating the survey UI to match the design shared by the client on Microsoft Teams.
3. Fixing survey connectivity issues to ensure smooth access.
4. Ensuring both the **“Survey”** and **“Participate Now”** buttons link to the same survey page.
5. Adding the new dataset provided by the client and integrating it with the existing dataset.

## Planning Options

The team considered the following approaches:

1. **Option 1:** Divide responsibilities and work in parallel (frontend, survey fixes, dataset integration).
2. **Option 2:** Prioritize frontend navigation fixes first, then address the survey-related tasks, before handling the dataset integration.

## Planning Rationale

- **Option 1 (Parallel Work):** Provides higher efficiency overall, as tasks are handled simultaneously.
- **Option 2 (Sequential Work):** Reduces potential conflicts, since the frontend navigation and survey components overlap in code dependencies.

After discussion, the team decided that **avoiding conflicts was more important than maximizing parallel efficiency**.

## Planning Outcome

The team agreed to proceed with **Option 2 (Sequential Work)** to ensure a stable and conflict-free implementation. The order of work will be:

1. Fix the frontend navigation for hot posts.
2. Repair the survey connectivity issue.
3. Update the survey UI to match the Teams design and link both “Survey” and “Participate Now” buttons to the same page.
4. Integrate the new dataset with the existing one.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Frontend Navigation Fix**
   - **Task:** Ensure clicking a hot post redirects to its detailed view.
   - **Action:** Update the routing logic and verify navigation in multiple browsers.
   - **Resources:** Frontend codebase, testing tools.
2. **Survey Connectivity**
   - **Task:** Fix issues preventing the survey page from loading.
   - **Action:** Diagnose API and database connections, implement fixes, and test stability.
   - **Resources:** Backend logs, database access.

## Risks and Mitigation

1. **Risk:** Frontend and survey UI overlap may still cause unexpected conflicts.
   - **Mitigation:** Implement sequential testing checkpoints before moving to the next task.
2. **Risk:** The survey connectivity fix may be delayed if external dependencies (e.g., client database or APIs) are unstable.
   - **Mitigation:** Document fallback approaches and escalate early to the client if issues persist.
3. **Risk:** New dataset integration may create inconsistencies with existing data.
   - **Mitigation:** Perform data validation and maintain backups before applying migrations.

## Follow-up Actions

1. Conduct an internal review of frontend and survey UI changes with the client’s design references.
2. Schedule a mid-sprint check-in meeting to evaluate progress and resolve blockers.
3. Verify dataset integration with the client to ensure accuracy and usability.
4. Prepare updated documentation for both frontend routing and survey workflows.

## Conclusion

This planning log defines the sequential approach chosen by the team to reduce potential conflicts between frontend and survey components. By prioritizing navigation fixes and survey stability before integrating new datasets, the plan ensures a smoother user experience and maintains system reliability while meeting client expectations.
