# Our Tech Stack

## Introduction

In our project, we aim to leverage the latest and most efficient technologies to build a scalable, maintainable, and high-performing application. This document details our comprehensive tech stack, chosen with careful consideration for frontend and backend development, as well as survey implementation.

## Frontend Technologies

Our frontend is engineered for speed, efficiency, and a seamless user experience, utilizing:

- **React.js**: Facilitates building dynamic user interfaces with its component-based architecture, improving the development process and ensuring a consistent UI.
- **Next.js**: Enhances our React app with server-side rendering and static site generation, optimizing performance and SEO.
- **Node.js**: Supports frontend development workflows, including build processes and dependency management.
- **Jest and React Testing Library**: Tools for writing unit and integration tests, ensuring our components work as intended before deployment.

## Backend Technologies

Our backend is designed for robustness and scalability, utilizing:

- **Nest.js**: Offers a comprehensive framework for building server-side applications with TypeScript, emphasizing modularity and maintainability.
- **Node.js**: Provides the runtime environment for our backend, offering efficient handling of asynchronous operations and a non-blocking I/O model.
- **Mongoose**: Depending on our project's data modeling needs, we use Mongoose for MongoDB, enhancing our ability to work with databases in a structured and efficient manner.
- **Jest**: For backend testing, ensuring our server logic is reliable and performs as expected under various conditions.

## Survey Tool

- **LabintheWild**: A versatile platform for conducting user research and surveys, allowing us to gather insights directly from our target audience, shaping our development to meet user needs effectively.

## Integration and Deployment

- **Docker**: Simplifies deployment and ensures consistency across environments by containerizing our application, making it easy to scale and deploy across different infrastructures.
- **GitHub Actions/CI/CD Pipelines**: Automates our testing and deployment processes, allowing for continuous integration and delivery, and ensuring that our codebase is always in a deployable state.

## Overall Design Consideration

### Frontend and Backend Separation

We maintain a clear separation between frontend and backend development to optimize team collaboration and efficiency. This separation allows for specialized focus areas, enhancing the quality and performance of both the user interface and server-side logic.

## Declaration

Our tech stack is the result of extensive research and careful consideration, aimed at providing the best possible platform for our application. As the technology landscape evolves, so too will our approach, ensuring that we remain at the cutting edge of development practices.
